# Data-Meter

Data meter is another program I created to scratch an itch I had. It measures the amount of traffic (upload and download) passing through a specified network adapter on the host machine. It logs the amount of data that's passed through the adapter to a text file every time the application shuts down. It was just a simple way of making sure I didn't exceed my monthly broadband cap. 

The software is written in C#, using .NET 3.5. MIT License. Do what you like with it, I don't really care.

Have fun!
